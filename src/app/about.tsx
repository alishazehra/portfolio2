 My name is Syeda Alisha Zehra, and I am a passionate software developer, educator, and lifelong learner with a love for technology and education. Here’s a bit about me:

My Journey in Web Development

I have a strong foundation in TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and I specialize in creating dynamic, responsive, and intuitive web applications. Over the years, I've honed my skills through various personal and academic projects, gaining experience with both front-end and back-end development.

Currently, I am expanding my expertise in Next.js, a framework I’m using for building modern, scalable web applications. Though I’ve worked on several projects using Next.js, I’m continuously learning to unlock its full potential, aiming to integrate AI and other cutting-edge technologies.
A personal portfolio where I showcase my work, including projects built with Next.js and other technologies.

A Travel Adventures blog redesign, focused on improving the user experience and making the site more modern, intuitive, and SEO-friendly.


Educational Background

I have completed both O levels and A levels and am now focused on advancing my knowledge in web development and AI. My academic journey in Sociology has further strengthened my ability to analyze human behavior, which I believe is essential for creating user-centered applications.

Future Goals

I am constantly pushing myself to expand my skill set. In the future, I aspire to:

Work in an IT firm and contribute to the tech industry.

Further my knowledge of AI and its practical applications.

Create more interactive and user-friendly web applications.

Continue to mentor and inspire others to pursue coding and technology.
